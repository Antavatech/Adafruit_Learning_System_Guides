CircuitPython I2S Tone playback example.
Plays a tone for one second on, one
second off, in a loop.
Remove this line and all of the following docstring content before submitting to the Learn repo.
Update the three I2S pins to match the wiring chosen for the microcontroller. If you are unsure of
a proper I2S pin combination, run the pin combination script found here:
https://adafru.it/i2s-pin-combo-finder
Update the following pin names to a viable pin combination:
* BIT_CLOCK_PIN
* WORD_SELECT_PIN
* DATA_PIN
